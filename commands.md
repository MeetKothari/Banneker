 ### To **print** a vector, simply use the built-in print function. The classes have been overloaded using a Dunder method to allow displaying the vectors as painless as possible.
 
### To **multiply** your vector by a scalar, it's possible to simply use the * operator. For anything further, you'll have to use the provided functions.
 
 **funcs.dotproduct(v1,v2):** computes the dotproduct of two given 2D Vectors.
 
 **funcs.thddotproduct(v1: ThDVector, v2: ThDVector):** computes the dotproduct of two given 3D Vectors.
 
 **def plot2D(v1):** plots a two-dimensional vector on a grid.
